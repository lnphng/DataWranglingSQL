# [Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-wrangling-analysis-abtesting)

In this Course, I have learned how you to apply the SQL skills to increasingly complex and authentic data science inquiry case studies. 
Not only that, I have a chance to learn how to highlight the level of detail needed for different kinds of questions and practice answering data questions as well as develop a strategy for answering all questions using data.

At the [final assignment](https://github.com/lnphng/DataWranglingSQL/blob/master/Final%20Assignment.sql), I can do SQL queries to create a metric that is tied to a business value, then aggregate a proportion metric and run the results through an AB testing calculator tool.

The datas to do all exercises and the [final assigment](https://app.mode.com/lnphng/reports/b7e8dc4e472b) are from [Mode](https://app.mode.com/) and also be implemented on [Mode](https://app.mode.com/).
